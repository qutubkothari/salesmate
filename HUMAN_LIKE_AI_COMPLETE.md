```

### 3. **Response Variation** 🎭

(Automatically varies - never sounds robotic)
```

## 📊 How Learning Works:

### Success Tracking:
```javascript
// When customer places order
ConversationLearningService.trackSuccess({
    tenantId: "tenant_123",
    customerQuery: "I need 100 pieces of 8x80 screws",
    aiResponse: "Great! 8x80 screws at ₹50/pc...",
    outcome: "order_placed",
    contextUsed: {
        website: true,
        products: true,
        history: true
    }
});
```

### Insights Generation:
```javascript
// Weekly analysis
const insights = await ConversationLearningService.generateInsightsReport(tenantId);

Results:
{
    totalInteractions: 247,
    successfulInteractions: 209,
    failedInteractions: 38,
    successRate: "84.6%",
    outcomeBreakdown: {
        order_placed: { success: 142, failed: 8 },
        question_answered: { success: 67, failed: 12 },
        lead_qualified: { success: 0, failed: 18 }
    }
}
```

### Context Effectiveness:
```javascript
// What works best?
const effectiveness = await ConversationLearningService.analyzeContextEffectiveness(tenantId);

Results:
{
    website: "92.3%",  // Website context leads to 92% success
    products: "87.1%", // Product catalog leads to 87% success
    history: "78.5%"   // Conversation history leads to 78% success
}
```
